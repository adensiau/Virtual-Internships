#🖥️ Virtual Internships


**📄 Description**

This project investigates the impact of communication patterns in a virtual internship environment on student performance. Using chat log data from an educational simulation of a biomedical engineering company, Nephrotex, we explore correlations between mentor-student interactions and final project scores.


**📊 Features**

* Multivariate regression analysis to identify correlations in communication data
* Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and key feature selection
* Classification models to predict student performance based on chat patterns
* Data balancing techniques (oversampling, undersampling) for improved model accuracy


**📂 Dataset/Resources**

* Chat log data from student interns and mentors
* Performance scores from final internship reports
* Preprocessing scripts for text data cleaning and feature extraction



🛠 Tech Stack

* Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
* Machine Learning (Regression, Classification, PCA)
* Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)


📊 Results & Insights
* Higher mentor interaction and frequent messages correlated with better performance
* Regression models showed weak predictive power; classification models performed better
* PCA revealed mentor interaction and total message count as key features
* Future improvements could include topic modeling and sentiment analysis for deeper insights
